# Getting Started with Admin Github Dashboard

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Set Up

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure Github Api by creating a new OAuth App under your Github account developer settings
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
3. copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and update the values
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser (disable Security to avoid cors problems).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:



### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
